This script allows you to take a screen shot with your preferable size and part of the screen, BUT you have to provide its X and Y positions. Yes its a pain, but it works.

If you are using a custom capture size without providing any X and Y coordinates for the position, then bring specific window or application towards the top-left of the screen.

When using custom size a new window would pop up giving a sample size of your capture.
